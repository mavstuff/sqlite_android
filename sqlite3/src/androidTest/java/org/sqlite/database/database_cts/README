The tests in this directory are modified versions of the SQLite tests in the
Android CTS (Compatibility Test Suite) project. This project is stored in
a git repository here:

  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/cts

The snapshot was taken from master branch commit id:

  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/cts/+/0794ecacb76b54eeee881762d0edfc83209ab05f

Within that project, the tests are in directory:

  ./tests/tests/database/src/android/database/cts/

So:

  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/cts/+/0794ecacb76b54eeee881762d0edfc83209ab05f/tests/tests/database/src/android/database/cts
